# Hey, I'm Pradeep  

Builder. Coder. Dreamer.  
I love writing code that lives **onchain** and building across both **Web2 and Web3**.  

---

## What I Do  
- **Onchain Development** – Crafting smart contracts and decentralized apps with security and scalability in mind.  
- **Full‑Stack Engineering** – From frontend polish to backend logic, I bridge Web2 and Web3 seamlessly.  
- **Blockchain Explorer** – Always experimenting with new protocols, L1s, and L2s to push boundaries.  

---

## My Vibe  
I’m not just “interested” in Web3—I live it. Whether it’s coding late nights, debugging contracts, or helping devs around me, I thrive on building things that matter.
